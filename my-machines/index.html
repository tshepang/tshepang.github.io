      <p>I have, since my first machine in 2004, owned 2 other complete systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>a Dell Inspiron desktop Core 2 Duo (Conroe) system boasting 2GB RAM
and 160GB HDD</li>
<li>a power-hungry and underperfoming Pentium 4 Prescott system
(3.06GHz/1GB RAM)</li>
</ul>
<p>I currently primarily use the old P4 and it's still pretty decent at
2.66GHz and 0.5GB of RAM. It also sports a DVD-Writer and 250GB HDD, all
SATA. The other systems are used by those close to me for one reason or
another.</p>
<p>The Dell Inspiron is my most recent machine. It got 3-year warranty on
it (which was quite a surprise) so I'm not touching its insides. This
system currently dual-boots with Windows XP which a relative of mine uses
for music production, a task he claims FLOSS can't satisfactorily
fulfill.</p>
<p>I should note the other systems I use at work:</p>
<ul>
<li>An HP Core 2 Duo Conroe 1.86GHz/1GB RAM desktop, my primary
workhorse for building Debian, which dual-boots with Windows XP
since it actually is a shared machine for those I work with in the
area (about a dozen people), and of course a bit over-powered for
what is claimed to be an 'email-checking' and 'printing'
machine. I just manage to find time in-between these email/printing
sessions to have it do the grunt-work.</li>
<li>a recently-acquired Pentium M 1.7GHz/500MB RAM HP/Compaq laptop
which provides quite decent performance too and a claimed battery
life of 2+ hrs. This system also dual-boots with Windows XP since
nearly all that we need at work uses it. It's also the system where
I do software/programming study and miscellaneous reading on since
it's the only system at work I have exclusive access to.
[<a href="https://tshepang-logs.statichost.eu/favorite-laptop/">expansion/update</a>]</li>
</ul>
<p>I've neglected to mention the other 2 systems I'm not interested in,
which I use at work for some work tasks, both Windows-based (and going
as far back as Windows 98!), and both under-powered but pretty
well-suited to their specific tasks (except that I still have to use
micro-floppy diskettes), and also uniteresting because they aren't
running my favorite operating system, Debian.</p>
<p>That's 6 systems in total all running Debian, 3 of which dual-boot with
Windows XP, 1 dual-booting with Windows Vista (the Core 2 laptop), and 2
(including my primary system, mt first) purely Debian. Of these, the
only one with internet access is the desktop HP system at work actually,
mainly because web-access in SA isn't nearly as affordable as I'd
like.</p>
