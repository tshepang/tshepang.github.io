      <p>Comments on articles tend to be bad, and if you are lucky, just decent.
They are seldom outstanding though, as seen of <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/movies/the-bang-bang-club-fizzles-with-compromises/article2011622/comments/">these ones</a> which are
critical of the article they respond to. Basically what's happening is
that the critic does offer a decent review, summarizing the story
nicely, but then resorts to unjustified criticism. That is sad,
especially because I found the movie quite good. Read them (the
comments), for they are better reviews than mine.</p>
<p>I am still going to given mine of course, by mentioning two main things
I really appreciate about the movie:</p>
<ul>
<li>The portrayal South Africa (my home) is quite authentic. There was
good research effort involved, to the point of even using the
now-obsolete cash. The behavior and the utterances of Black people
wasn't screwed up either (as it so often happens when foreigners
set a movie here). The one complaint I have is that the white guys
aren't convincing as South Africans, and there doesn't seem to be
any real effort to mimic local accents. I even thought that the real
life Club members were foreigners.</li>
<li>I was amazed by the performance of one local actor, <a href="https://www.google.co.za/search?q=patrick+shai">Patrick Shai</a>.
I've never given kudos to the guy, though he never got a heck of a
lot of chances to strut his stuff (the local movie industry is
nearly non-existent), but he really shined here, and gives the
movie's best performance. I also find his character to be the
movie's most interesting because, regardless of him being among the
leaders of a small group of tribal killers, he also happens to have
a soft side... literally a savior of one heroic guy. Watching him
was a serious relief since I was concerned that these guys would be
some sort of faceless aggressors/victims. Sure about all of them
were, but at least there was him, and one other guy saddened by the
death of wife and child.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an important movie, and it's sad that it hasn't achieved the
popularity it deserves. I'm still not going to claim it's a
masterpiece because, other than that performance, I'm not sure I wanna
give it a repeat viewing. It's not because it's unpleasant. It just
feels that what kept me glued were moments that won't be so thrilling
second time around. I don't know, I'll see.</p>
<p><strong>nit-picks</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>That scene depicting <a href="http://iconicphotos.wordpress.com/2009/08/12/vulture-stalking-a-child/">vulture and child in hungry Sudan</a> should not
have been attempted, or at least removed from the movie. It adds
nothing to the movie, and too iconic a moment of history to be given
such a lame attempt. For one, the child in the movie didn't look as
bony.</li>
<li>I was left hungry for further exploration of the political climate
of South Africa, beyond the unconvincing angry Black guy criticizing
the White guys from profiting from taking photos of those in pain.
In fact I think it's this sort of thing that makes the
<a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/movies/the-bang-bang-club-fizzles-with-compromises/article2011622/">'unjustified' criticism</a> I mentioned above make some sense. Such
things tend to only dawn on me some time after the movie has ended.</li>
</ul>
