      <p>I don't remember any movie based in India quite as rich and vivid as
<em>Slumdog Millionaire</em>, a painful and seemingly pointless exercise which
happens to be India's answer to the similar <em>City of God</em>.</p>
<p>It was a pleasant surprise to find Darren Aronofsky helming <em>The
Wrestler</em>, a small but solid, yet-another-fallen-sportsman-story with an
amazing cast and a very strong Mickey Rourke, whose character is in such
pain that death ought to be better. And this movie appears the most
conventional of Aronofsky's (think of the mesmerising <em>Pi</em> or the
heart-wrenching <em>Requiem for A Dream</em>).</p>
<p>On a lighter note, we got the most enchanting <em>Wall-E</em>, a touching story
of undefeatable love which got a strange quality of very quick
story-telling, and not a dull moment. It's superior even to its awesome
predecessor, <em>Robots</em>. It's on the league of <em>Monsters, Inc.</em>, <em>The
Incredibles</em>, and <em>Ratatouille</em> on their heydey.</p>
<p>I was delighted by the light-hearted <em>Zack &amp; Miri Make A Porno</em> until it
insulted me with shitty-ass, formulaic, romantic comedy bullshit towards
the end.</p>
<p>Numerous Adam Sandler comedies have showcased him as a laid-back and
tough guy, but none with the flair of <em>You Don't Mess With the Zohan</em>,
a weird and exciting fantasy/satire regarding middle-Eastern peoples.
The only comparably-excellent movie Adam has been in is <em>Punch-Drunk
Love</em>.</p>
