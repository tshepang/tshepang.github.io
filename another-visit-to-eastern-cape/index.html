      <p><a href="https://tshepang.github.io/a-visit-to-eastern-cape/">Last time</a>, I raved about my experiences at a friend's home place,
Nyosini. My memory is not to be completely trusted, but this second (or
third, if we count attending <a href="https://tshepang.github.io/one-less-angel/">a funeral</a>) one was even better. Such
hospitality is what I feel most people on the planet have never
experienced. We (me and two friends, who were just as impressed) were
treated like royalty. We slept there just one night though, so we spent
nearly all our time there in one yard.</p>
<p>I have never seen a family quite like this. My own (maternal) family is
quite close, but definitely not as kindly as this one. And by the way,
there are no exceptions. The love they have, and express, for each other
is... damn I wish I could express self better.</p>
<p>I met Bongo again, and the guy's character hasn't changed a bit...
maybe even more shy than last time, I can't tell. Lwazi and Siya
weren't there (boarding school).</p>
<p>One could say it was me (us?) paying homage to that wonderful family
(it's been over 3 years), but also an excuse to go enjoy the warmth of
their welcome, not to mention the gorgeous scenery of the surrounding
hills.</p>
