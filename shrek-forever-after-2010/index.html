      <p>I didn't expect much from this one, given that I find the series rather
overrated, bar the 2nd movie. But this one is quite an experience, and
far superior to any of them.</p>
<p>I liked:</p>
<ul>
<li>the kid that insists on Shrek screaming</li>
<li>Donkey was actually interesting</li>
<li>the warrior Fiona was great to watch</li>
<li>the villain was fun to watch, and his mannerisms reminds of that of
the title character of <em>Megamind</em></li>
<li>the story is a lotta fun</li>
<li>the Ogres species was fun to watch, and it was interesting to note
that he looked like nothing compared to some of them; character
design is amazing; check especially the cook</li>
<li>great humor: the villain serving the witches; the cook proposing
serving food during battle; the meet between fat cat and donkey</li>
<li>the early scenes in which Shrek harks back to the early,
freedom-filled, days</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>update</strong>:</p>
<p>Movie revisits can be real strange. The first time I watched this one, I
deemed it a masterpiece, but a revisit proved it not much better than
the others in the <em>Shrek</em> franchise. It makes me wonder... maybe my
mood was different. It's not as bad as the worst in the series (<em>Shrek
3</em>), but it doesn't seem as good as the 2nd (<em>Shrek 2</em>).</p>
<p>Technically, it's a little disappointing (the human faces are really
bad, not much better than the original <em>Toy Story</em> (1995). None of the
visuals are any impressive either, well other than Donkey's fur, which
sometimes look photo-realistic. Luckily the new ogres are interesting,
far more interesting than Shrek himself, my most favorite being the
cook. And of the previous elements I watched, Fiona was no longer
interesting, and villain not as much fun nor is the story.</p>
