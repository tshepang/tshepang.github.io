      <p>So these guys at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-25.776454,28.349731">BMW Bavarian East Pretoria</a> (it has since been
closed), a motorbike dealership, got me impressed with their great
customer service. The standard procedure is to lend customers a bike for
a few hours to use during the day, which normally happens when one takes
the bike in for service. My <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_F650CS">F650CS</a> was giving me some trouble which
actually perplexed them for more than those few hours... a few weeks
actually.</p>
<p>So why I says they rock:</p>
<ul>
<li>I wasn't charged for the extra (perhaps dozens) hours of labour.</li>
<li>I was lent a bike (actually 3, since the troubleshooting went for so
long that they needed to sell 2 of those bikes in the meanwhile).</li>
<li>Not sure if I should call this negligence, but there seems to be
some deep trust these guys have for their customers, because no one
cared to check if I could ride the variety of bikes they lent me.
That's gorgeous, especially considering that one of the bikes they
lent me was the superhot <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_F800S">BMW F800S</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course there is also the element of them encouraging loyalty, but
this still goes beyond the normal "customer is king" routine.</p>
