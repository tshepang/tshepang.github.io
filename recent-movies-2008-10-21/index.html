      <p>A really good drama can be found in the very engaging (and painful)
<em>House of Sand and Fog</em>, which also got Ben Kingsley providing quite a
performance. It also got beautiful camerawork and sets in places, and
beautiful women too.</p>
<p>A good candidate for the ultimate 'girl power' movie is <em>The Descent</em>,
even though I don't see the point of its subplot of a woman losing her
family; And the creatures look like those from <a href="https://tshepang.github.io/i-am-legend/">I Am Legend</a>.</p>
<p><em>Wild Hogs</em> is a fine movie with a fresh storyline (though <em>City
Slickers</em> had a similar concept), but it appears its creators didn't
really know how to run with the story, specially with an ending that
don't do it justice; William H. Macy is pure bliss.</p>
<p>I was quite surprised that it was John Lequizamo playing the delightful
villain in <em>Spawn</em>, being the real center of the movie and is about its
only saviour. The guy really is talented and helps the movie get
bearable. It was perhaps 10 years back when I first watched it, and even
was unsatisfied especially by Satan, and then by Martin Sheen as a very
miscast villain. It's a very bad movie with disgusting visuals, even for
its time.</p>
<p>One thing that attracted me to <em>Closer</em> is Mike Nichol's attachment as
director and he here crafts a movie of gorgeous sets and camerawork
armed with a fresh and original storyline, albeit depressing.</p>
