      <p>It starts off amazingly well, with the same level of movie magic offered
by gems like <em>The Incredibles</em> and <a href="https://tshepang.github.io/megamind-2010/">Megamind</a>, but is funnier by far.
Sadly, halfway through, things start being not so okay. That's when we
get the ever-uninteresting, slow-the-movie-down morality talk, which
includes the beloved hero getting a little too cocky. There's also some
annoying moments where the town inhabitants treat this hero unfairly,
like the moment where they attempt to attack him when something goes
wrong with his food-making machine. It's fine when they are shallow and
stupid, but it gets unbearable when the writers makes them so
<a href="https://tshepang.github.io/unforgiving-characters-are-annoying/">unappreciative</a>. One other not-too-kool thing is when these writers
push the boundaries of fantasy way too far when the food surrounding the
machine gain awareness, attacking the heroes to trying to shut the
machine down. That was just needless; the movie was already more than
good enough. Also, the mayor was just too annoying, given some villainy
that's left unexplained.</p>
<p>Okay, back to the good stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li>The character design is amazing and so is the animation.</li>
<li>I enjoyed the character of the police officer, and the love he
showed for his son was touching.</li>
<li>The lead character is recycled, but still exciting enough.</li>
<li>The concept is great, and exploited well enough, even though it runs
out of steam about halfway through.</li>
<li>The food design is great. It reminds me of <em>Ratatouille</em>, and even
rivals it. The most amazing of them all is the ice cream.</li>
<li>The jelly castle was a setting for the most enchanting moment,
making me wish fantasy was real.</li>
</ul>
