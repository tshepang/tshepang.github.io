      <p><em>I hardly ever write anything about tv productions regardless of how
many times I tend to get impressed, and there hasn't been a shortage of
that. That's mainly due to laziness/motivation, but this time I just
have to mention this one gem.</em></p>
<p>The very last episode of the Season mainly focuses on the trial of one
former president who is accused of treason due to surrendering to the
cylons (a species created by humans) as well as giving them official
approval to execute dozens of people. The defence given by an assistant
lawyer is a masterpiece, and would match well with any court thing I've
seen in my tv/movie-watching history. The performance matches as well,
and that's interesting because the performer/character combination is
among the least interesting in the series.</p>
<p>As a sidenote, I find this Season to be the best (in a series of four),
because it covers more interesting events (the capturing of the humans,
the resistance, their eventual rescue, and a lot more, best of which was
the trial of course).</p>
<p>This positiveness could make it look like I'm a huge fan of the series,
but I'm not. There's a whole lot of religious non-sense that I can't
bear, some seriously annoying characters, at least one overly eccentric one,
too much day-dreaming, some too-stupid plot decisions... but Episode 20
goes some way to help me forgive the rest of the shit.</p>
