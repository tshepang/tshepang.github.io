      <p>Nicole Kidman has played troubled women quite a few times before, but
the performance she gives here is quite fresh, and really unlike
anything I've seen before, either from her or anyone else. The
character she plays is also quite thoroughly developed, and my shitty
memory says she is the greatest female asshole I've seen yet in any
movie. This character is grieving of son's accidental death.</p>
<p>The guy playing the killer gives the movie's best performance, and
perhaps the best teenage performance in any movie (remember the quality
of my memory). He's fucking amazing. And this is a movie not having any
shortage of excellent acting. Most notably, we have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandra_Oh">Sandra Oh</a>, who is
as desirable as she is excellent. She is a good actor, but she hasn't
in my eyes done anything better than this.</p>
<p>I'm still not sure about Aaron Eckhart. Not a bad performance at all,
but he's too uninteresting. I'm also not sure about the lady playing
the mother. Not bad either, but not too believable.</p>
<p>The dialog is quite good and so is the camerawork. The great direction
easily hides the fact the movie itself is pretty much plotless.</p>
