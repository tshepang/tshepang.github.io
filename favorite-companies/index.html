      <p>Here are some reasons why I like some companies a lot:</p>
<ul>
<li>how they appear to be managed</li>
<li>what they build</li>
<li>their Rust embrace</li>
</ul>
<p>Here goes, and they need not show strongly in all of the 3 reasons above...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://ferrous-systems.com">Ferrous Systems</a>, which offers Rust consulting and training,
also does a lot for the language in the embedded domain by running <a href="https://oxidizeconf.com">Oxidize</a>.
That, combined with having Jonathan Pallant and Jorge Aparicio in their employ
(and James Munns previously),
makes the company the most visible name in that domain for Rust.
I am also excited for <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/ferrocene">Ferrocene</a>,
which is their effort in getting Rust to be used in
"Safety-critical sectors, such as automotive, railway, and aerospace".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://igalia.com">Igalia</a>,
an open source consultancy company most visible in open source web browser work
(they make large contributions to all 3 major browser engines),
also happens to be a worker cooperative.
As is the case with such organisation kinds,
all workers are involved in business decisions,
and they also get the same pay.
They recently began re-igniting the development of Servo,
a project that pioneered a number of browser components written in Rust,
some of which are now included in Firefox.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://mullvad.net">Mullvad</a>, which offers a VPN service,
develop their tools <a href="https://github.com/mullvad">in public</a> (open source),
and Rust features a lot in those.
Reading through their site leaves me impressed about how
serious they are about security and privacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://oxide.computer">Oxide</a>, which builds server racks,
also makes heavy use of Rust as well as open source firmware.
Best of all, <a href="https://oxide.computer/blog/compensation-as-a-reflection-of-values">all workers get the same pay</a>!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.fastly.com">Fastly</a>, which offers various internet services,
is a key player in the Wasm ecosystem,
as evidenced by employing giants such as <a href="https://github.com/sunfishcode">Dan Gohman</a>,
or heavily sponsoring work on important projects such as <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime">Wasmtime</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
