      <p>Although there's nothing new, <em>Our Family Wedding</em> is such a delight,
and nearly all characters are beautiful, but most especially the 2
fathers (superb acting), and their childish exploits. The thing is
spoilt by some shitty comic touches here and there, especially the goat
thing.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the highly-underrated <em>The Lottery Ticket</em>; it's very
well-made and funny, except it was rather too stagey with a miscast
performance of Ice Cube. Of special note was the guy playing Bow Wow's
friend. I could see the appeal the first moment he showed up on screen.
Look out for the scene on the roof where both the guys shine.</p>
<p><em>Last Action Hero</em> is annoying partly because it uses the same movie
formula that it ridicules, though not as heavily as spoofs tend to.
It's also annoying because, amidst the noise, it has 2 superb villains,
the glass eye, and the child killer. I loved them back over a decade
ago, and still love them now, so much that I wish their characters
(extremely well done) could be exploited a little more, and in a better
movie. Slater's daughter is beloved.</p>
<p>I'm sucker for tough gals in movies (as opposed to those who act tough)
and one recent such character is Carrie-Anne Moss' FBI agent in
<em>Unthinkable</em>, a well-made movie spoilt by underdeveloped characters,
most notably Samuel L. Jackson's. And I love the ending. I actually
screamed excitement at the end.</p>
