I saw this as a good opportunity to finally try something other than GNOME as my primary environment on my home machine. I have before tinkered with other GUI environments (XFCE, KDE 3, FluxBox, LXDE, and most recently, Window Maker) and kept going back, but I think this time I will actually abandon GNOME permanently. This is after being an adherent for nearly a decade. I been playing with dwm for the past few days, and the experience has convinced me to stay. I am attracted to the philosophy of minimalism, though I find they do take things a bit far in requiring users to tinker with C source code in order to configure it. Luckily it's not hard, and there's examples out there. It just takes a while since there isn't a comprehensive guide I could find. For my login manager, I use LightDM . I added this line to its configuration, in [SeatDefaults] section: greeter-hide-users=false It removes the need to manually enter my username each time I want to login. Reason I'm not using GDM? I wanted something light, which also wouldn't pull in dozens of packages that I won't use. For example: $ sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends gdm3 Reading package lists...

Need to get 0 B/31.0 MB of archives. After this operation, 90.8 MB of additional disk space will be used. GNOME philosophy tends towards tight integration, leading to things being not as modular as I would like: how could a display manager end up depending on a Contacts tool, or the Bluetooth stack. It may very well be just how it was built in Debian, but that also means there were build options that allowed such tight coupling in the first place. GDM has served me well for years, but I'm not interested in all those tools it brings with. Anyways, enough with that.

At times, someone in the lower ranks of the hierarchy happen to be more active in the project than the Author, in which case the Author often makes them Maintainer, explicitly or not. Maintainer This is someone ultimately responsible for the project: handles bug reports, decides which changes to accept from lower contributors, and performs releases. Note that there can be more than one, unlike is the case with Author. Contributor This is someone who submits improvements to project, either documentation or code. It can be a one-time contribution, but in case where this is frequent and spans a certain amount of time, she can move onto becoming a Maintainer. Bug Reporter This is someone who suggests improvements to the project. Depending on the project, any of these are used: a mailing list, an IRC channel, a social networking service, email, or a dedicated Issue/Bug tracking system can be used. User What the user is depends on the project, of course. Just to be clear, in the case of Python project, the user is a software developer, not the person who ends up using something written in the language. The 'individual' in title means I'm ignoring non-human entities, like companies. I'm also ignoring non-core activities, like marketers or sysadmins, or even teachers. Those are not going to be easy to fit in this simple story, and are not common to that many FLOSS (Free/Libre and Open Source) projects.

Reason: slow liquidluck development ( the author is busy with other projects ), though he has more recently been doing some large changes in a branch , which I assume is not ready. There is also a backlog of doc improvements I submitted, which are not even acknowledged. Do not consider this a complaint... the author in fact gave me more than I gave him... a nice piece of software. In fact, I might go back at some point, and will keep maintaining live demos of the various liquidluck themes . Also, my movie blog is also still built with liquidluck. I have a separate post on what I love about static website generators . why Pelican rocks It has categories ( unlike nikola ) Post metadata: if Date is not specified, file mtime is used (unlike blogofile ) if Category is not specified, parent directory name is used (unlike blogofile) titles are allowed to have any character (unlike blogofile) there is an option to provide clean urls... remove trailing .html Does not force one into having ugly date-based filesystem structure ( unlike tinkerer ) why Pelican rocks not The default theme simply didn't fit my tastes, and the other themes weren't so satisfactory . I spent way too long fiddling with them, and just couldn't be happy. why liquidluck So I have moved to liquidluck , and am hoping I will not be 'forced' to move again. It's way too much work, and it took multiple messages between me and the developer of this sleek new static site generator just to get it to behave the way I like it. I had to override stuff that's done by the software, by using this script , which helped give it the advantages that Pelican has over the other generators I mentioned, while also solving the one problem Pelican has.. lack of a good-enough theme. This was achieved with the help of that very helpful and responsive developer. issues There is no visible way, at least for the default theme, to subscribe to RSS feeds of individual Categories. The text is a bit blurry/faint with the default theme, and none of the other ones are close to good-enough for my liking, all but the promising one named responsive . It got 2 issues so far (see live demo ): Date is displayed at the bottom of a post... why make user scroll that far before presenting such a key piece of info. There is no link anywhere allowing to visit Home. Background color for <code> text is too unusual, and results in an ugly look. It does not fit with the general general theme, so should be grey really, which would match with that of <pre> text. I fixed it myself with the following patch: diff --git a/liquidluck/_themes/default/static/style.css b/liquidluck/_themes/default/static/style.css index e90de80..94fa7e8 100644 --- a/liquidluck/_themes/default/static/style.css +++ b/liquidluck/_themes/default/static/style.css @@ -112,7 +112,7 @@ pre { border-radius: 3px; } code, tt { - background-color: #fee9cc; + background-color: #eee; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); padding: 1px 3px; font-size: 12px;","loc":"http://tshepang.net/from-pelican-to-liquidluck"},{"title":"about 'developer of note' series","tags":"computing","text":"I respect a lot of software developers, but many of those are not going to have an entry in this series, and not because they are lesser in my eyes.

Thing is, if you write about someone, you actually need to have some content (duh!), and saying \"Guide van Rossum rocks for creating Python, and am grateful!\" is simply not enough, hence a need for a trigger. In fact, I used to call this series developer of the moment , but at some point felt that the new name is more fitting, especially since a few of these honorable developers actually generated some new triggers along the way. The more obvious requirement is that the developer need to have done some thing that I truly appreciate.

This post was first published on 2012-05-20 , which is before I started using liquidluck , a competing tool. And then I moved back 2013-09-29 due to development inactivity of liquidluck. Pelican is a static blog generator; it converts marked-up text files to html (Pelican supports Markdown and reStructuredText ). The resulting site is complete with an index (Archives view), Tags, Categories, and Pages (for non-bloggy stuff like a CV or About Me file). As for my blog, its tree structure looks like this: build/... pages/about-me.rst posts/{arts/, computing/, misc/} CNAME fabfile.py new-post.py README.rst settings.py The build directory is where the output of the build process is stored. The pages directory is for any content that isn't blog posts. The posts directory is where the large chunk of content lives, the blog posts themselves. Each of the four directories in there represent a Category, for example: if you place some file in arts/ , the post will be marked as falling under arts Category. I host my blog on GitHub, using a service the call GitHub Pages. CNAME is a file required by that service in the case where I want to use a domain other than tshepang.github.io . It's content is tshepang.net . fabfile.py contains the build instructions, all for convenience so that I only need to run 2 commands, one for the build, and another for GitHub upload. However, I mostly just run one command that does both. The settings.py file contains Pelican configuration. It should be somewhat mostly self-explanatory, but for those things that aren't so obvious, do consult the documentation. README.rst has some basic instructions, as well as repository license. Now as for the post itself, you need metadata to go with it. This is stuff like title, date, and tags. It can be tedious to create all such mundate stuff, especially the date. That's why I wrote a script that generates that file and populates it with the given metadata: $ python new-post.py 'my blogging setup' misc --tags blogging This is the metadata, and also the beginning of the file: my blogging setup ================= :date: 2012-04-12 :tags: blogging The script also opens the file in my favorite editor, so I can start adding content. When I'm done with the changes, I ensure I'm in the root directory of my blog, commit ( hg commit --message 'new post' ) and run: $ fab That's a fabric command that uses the instructions found in fabfile.py . It builds the site, and then pushes it to GitHub Pages. It also pushes the sources to Bitbucket. Within a minute, the blog will be updated.","loc":"http://tshepang.net/blogging-with-pelican"},{"title":"favorite buildings","tags":"misc","text":"Burj Khalifa : tallest building on earth beautiful, iconic design Petronas Towers : third tallest buildings on earth stunning design Willis Tower (was Sears Tower) long-time tallest building (a wonder of my teenage years, and beyond) icon of Chicago skyline The WTC Twin Towers would be here if they were still standing.

The series' normal formula is that our heroic, bespectacled hero would mention the details of the new person, and his very capable sidekick, a former assassin, would go follow this person, to try avert the impending crime. In the 16th episode of the 2nd season, however, this formula isn't followed (by the camera). Instead we follow the person who would be victim, and our heroes only appear midway through, like they were secondary characters. It's beautiful. I love it when such breaks from normal routine occur, especially when they are as well-made. Not to say this is the best episode of this series so far (I can think of a few which were superior), nor was this the first time such a break from normal routine occur (there were some in the earlier episodes of the season), but it felt fresh enough to be worth a mention in this blog of mine. What added to the excitement is that it was the first time in the series that a so-called Relevant [1] crime prevention was showed. [1] This means relevant to (U.S.) national security.

I haven't played any of the other 4 games in the series. I have known about the first game for years, before playing it, and it was among the top of my wishlist. The appeal was simply the imagery of the angry lead character (Kratos), the giants he was portrayed to battle, the setting (ancient Greek mythology), as well as the title. When I finally managed to get my hands on the games (about 2 years ago), they did not disappoint. The epic feel of it all, the character design (the best ever that covers ancient Greek mythology), and (as regards God of War III ) impressive realism, makes for a fantastic series. Sadly, this trilogy is only available for PlayStation (2 & 3). My favorite characters: Hercules (demigod, son of Zeus), who appears in the 3rd game of the trilogy, is a mini-giant with an massive muscle structure and an interesting attitude, not to mention armed with some awesomely large and powerful weapons, that the playable character (Kratos) luckily gets to play with. The moment where this Hercules character appears is among my most favorite battle scenes in the whole trilogy. Hades (God of the Underworld), who we also only get to fight in the 3rd game of the trilogy, is another great design, and his underworld the best environment of the whole trilogy. His assortment of weapons is also quite impressive, but the battle involving him, though quite good, could be more epic. The Centaur General (human-horse being) were quite a presence. Not only were they rather tough to beat, but they were also the most charming characters in the whole trilogy. One wishes they had a greater screen time. Note that there were other Centaurs in the trilogy, but these particular ones were most interesting, and their slaying most... beautiful. They appear first time in the 3rd game in the trilogy. Poseidon (God of the Sea), is an interesting one. His represents the most complex (and hardest) fight sequence in the entire trilogy, it it also happens on the third installment of this fine trilogy. It's not exactly my favorite, but his character has a certain level of charm, and the final kill is particularly brutal. Kratos, the protagonist, was most impressive in the first game, but he was getting less interesting later on and the novelty of his anger was wearing off. He was also getting petty at times, and too bloodthirsty to be convincing. Regardless, he is a work of superb character design, and this well-enhanced by the pale color and red stripes on his skin, as well as a body that makes him look like pure lethal. Stone Talos are a one-of-a-kind character... muscular stone statues that come to life to incur damage on our protagonist. Awesome as it is, the series does have weaknesses: There is one notable bad work of character design, which is Ares, the original god of war (a title Kratos took from him after defeating him). He is totally uninresting (and clumsy), and the battle in which the two fight is the worst in the trilogy. One other horrible character was the goat-snake-lion combo character. It was probably a first in gaming history, but it was a real stupid idea. There were also some particilarly hard stages to pass, where I had to ask for help from a friend to proceed to the next level. I hate stuff like that... I normally pick the easiest difficulty level in games, for I hate to struggle for too long.","loc":"http://tshepang.net/god-of-war-trilogy"},{"title":"developer of note: Barry Warsaw","tags":"computing","text":"This guy, both an official Ubuntu developer and a core CPython developer, is a great example of a FLOSS collaborator.

Also, his great work has been officially recognized by the Python Software Foundation . The first work that prompted this recognition as developer of note is the proposal, PEP 413 . The idea is that the Python standard library (stdlib) should release at a quicker rate than the Python language itself. This is a nice balance between two camps: those favoring stability over quicker availability of features, and those favoring the opposite. The PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal) is quite thorough, and is partly in opposition to the earlier PEP 407 , which proposes that all of CPython (the language and its stdlib) should release faster. Nick Coghlan outlines the disadvantages with that approach in PEP 413 as well. Another PEP he is working on is PEP 432 . Titled Simplifying the CPython startup sequence , it's a highly detailed proposal to re-organise some of CPython code to ease maintenance. His deep knowledge on the project's internals is also exposed. Nick also builds and maintains a collection of notes known simply as Nick Coghlan's Python Notes .

Parallel systems will help designers develop nanotechnology, and nanocomputers will later be used to build massively parallel (trillion processor and up) computer systems. Finally, if powerful systems are to be useful in molecular design, they will need to be accessible through fast, clean, intuitive interfaces that let designers see and manipulate model molecules.

Referring specifically to CPython, the reference implementation of my favorite programming language, you can have literally hundreds of messages on the mailing lists, and at times, many more in the issue tracking system, all discussing the change in mind. Such changes are most often accompanied with a PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal), a formalised document which is basically a design spec for the change in mind. It also, helpfully, summarises the arguments against the change, and addresses them while at it, which can be of help to those not inclined to consume the oft-lengthy discussions. Given all that, it can be quite challenging for any one individual to champion such important changes, and an example of one such heroic individual is Victor Stinner , a core CPython developer.

There are many such additions, many a lot more important than this specific one, but what's most unique about this one is the sheer amount of discussion that went around this particular PEP. The mailing list discussions were practically endless, and so were the updates to the PEP, not to mention the amount of research involved, which was needed in order to have CPython expose the new functionality in a cross-platform manner.

Let me give an example of user wanting to install a package named nautilus, but avoid installing its Recommends depencencies: # ole wajig \u2014norecommends INSTALL nautilus # new wajig INSTALL \u2014norecommends nautilus I call this natural because it makes more sense to have the --norecommends command line option to be specified after the (wajig) subcommand it modifies. Also, the way it was implemented previously, the option would silently be ignored if it was used in a case where it was irrelevant. That's not good, and it links to the next user-visible change. There is less magic and more strictness. Previously, these commands resulted in the same outcome: wajig REMOVEORPHANS wajig REMOVE-ORPHANS wajig R-____EMOVE-ORPH----___AN_S What wajig did was simply sanitise the commands, getting rid of the junk. Well, I don't like that, but since I didn't want to break people's commands/aliases/scripts I actually tried to preserve that functionality, but argparse didn't let me do that, and messing around with sys.argv before argparse jumped in was an error-prone mess, which links us to the next change, this time behind-the-scenes. I replaced the archaic getopt CLI parser with a far more powerful argparse . This change alone, when I truly embraced it, using its subcommand methods (see point 1 above), resulting in a ridiculous work that involved mainly unfun work and resulted in changing (adding and removing) thousands of lines code. The output of command wajig COMMANDS is now generated dynamically, instead of simply being read from a separate file. Advantage is that it should now remain more up-to-date. The usage info for each COMMAND was store on its own file, and the aliases were symblic links to them. Now that's ugly, but I did it that was some time ago because I could not think of a better, quick way. The ugly solution is simple, but it added over a 100 files in user machines, which is just bad design. Well, modern Linux-based package management makes such invisible to all but the most avid/curious users, but I never liked it anyways. Now, all of that help info is auto-generated by argparse (you can imagine I'm a big fan of that module by now). There's bunch of other changes, though most was code stuff. As for the user-visible stuff, a few COMMANDS were removed, a few options added/removed.

I use a great tool named reprepro for this, and this is the command I use to update that repository, given the location of the fresh package files: $ reprepro -vv --basedir ~/.custom_repo/ includedeb tshepang /var/cache/apt/archives/*deb What's nice about the command is that, if there is an older version of the pacakge I'm adding, it gets replaced, and the package index is update accordingly. and now to the topic at hand I run that command more or less regularly, but very often the repository accumulates some junk: If a package gets renamed, reprepro has no way of knowing (at least as far as my setup goes). One notable case of this is Debian kernels, whose names match the major release versions (e.g. linux-image-3.1.0-1-686-pae becomes linux-image-3.2.0-1-686-pae when a new upstream release gets packaged). Lots other packages change names, and very often, for a variety of reasons (Debian is a little chaotic, often out of necessity, and it's amazing that its developers keep it so damn stable given all this change). If I add a package from an external repository or that I converted from an rpm, reprepro has no way of knowing that fact. Now if I stop using that package, it is just a waste of resources (CPU and disk usage). To help with the cleanup, I have written the following simple script: #!/usr/bin/env python3 import apt_pkg import gzip import subprocess CUSTOM_REPO = ( \"/home/wena/.custom_repo/dists/tshepang/main/\" \"binary-i386/Packages.gz\" ) WHEEZY_REPO = ( \"/var/lib/apt/lists/ftp.de.debian.org_debian_dists_testing_{}_\" \"binary-i386_Packages\" ) def main (): custom_repo = apt_pkg .

What it does is look for packages which are only available in my custom reposity, as compared with the one in Wheezy (soon to be Debian 7).

The project is distributed with a lot of jar files, supposedly for the convenience of users. When we work on a project, we just add all those jars to the classpath (we use Eclipse, an excessively powerful and ugly IDE). Now, me being a sucker for the Debian way of doing things, I'd install packages providing all those jars from a Debian repository, then remove those Mule-distributed files, then add symlinks in place of them pointing back to the actualy files. Imagine how much time it took! Either that, or even easier (but still time-consuming), skip the symlink thing entirely and just add those jars (found in /usr/share/java directory) directly. Beyond just wasting time, the are other potential problems with my approach: Debian's jar versions did tend to be different to Mule-supplied versions. You can imagine what problems this can cause, especially because the versions included there are most likely the ones used for testing Mule. Even if the versions were the same, what if there are slight changes from Debian's side. Debian's strict software guidelines implies that they'll strip out some stuff that doesn't adhere. The good thing is that Debian appends dfsg to the version number, but not everybody knows that . And even if they did, they would then need to spend time checking exactly what changed. Debian doesn't merely re-distribute the jar files. They actually rebuild them, with Debian-supplied compilers. Maybe this isn't an issue for Java projects, but who knows. This is not to knock the Debian way of doing things. It's actually quite excellent (hence my love), but it can't fit all scenarios.

The defence given by an assistant lawyer is a masterpiece, and would match well with any court thing I've seen in my tv/movie-watching history. The performance matches as well, and that's interesting because the performer/character combination is among the least interesting in the series.

What else I really liked about it is the feature-packed touchpad: Beyond the normal two-finger and side-scrolling, it also had up-down-left-right buttons which allowed constant-speed scrolling. It's interesting that such a touchpad is very rare. I now got an HP Probook 4530s and its pros: it's stunning it's got a real fast hard drive; there were times when I saw speeds upwards to 70MB/s, which I never saw with the older laptop its Wi-Fi doesn't require non-free software it's far more modern (USB3 support) and supposedly faster (Core i5-2410M vs. Core 2 Duo T7500), but my typical workload made even the TravelMate more than adequate And the cons: a less featureful touchpad keyboard keys placed in weird locations (e.g. pg up and pg dn buttons are placed far away, at the top-right corner; I blame the (needless for me) numeric keypad the screen resolution is on the low side and so is the screen size; the older laptop is much bigger even if they are both labeled 15.4\" ...and Debian: Quite a few times, I tend to want to stick to a stable release of Debian.

But that wasn't enough, so I ended up installing Xorg components from Debian Unstable (Suspend doesn't work well with Squeeze (Debian 6) and backports doesn't have a newer X version. Let's see how long I last trying to keep pure by running as little from outside Squeeze as possible. update : This didn't even last for 1 day. I was having issues with my X hanging the entire OS, forcing me to do a hard-reboot. This happened when I was watching a video using VLC, so I blamed it and installed the version from Debian Unstable. Sadly, doing things that way resulted in a VLC that refused to die normally, forcing me to do kill -9 vlc . I then just screwed my plans and upgraded fully to Unstable, and now VLC quits gracefully. Let's see if I'll have the X lockup again. update 2 : Well, I still experience machine lock-ups, the bad ones forcing a hard-reboot. This might be related to Wi-Fi because I used the system for quite a while using the wired link, without any such lock-up. update 3 : No more lock-ups, except very rarely. I run a mix of Testing and Unstable at the moment, but my \"/etc/sources.list\" file points solely at my custom repository and Testing, for it just is tiring to keep tracking Unstable... way too much bandwidth.","loc":"http://tshepang.net/moving-from-acer-travelmate-to-hp-probook-using-debian"},{"title":"links 2011-07-15","tags":"computing","text":"What's up with MeeGo? a really good bug report \u2013 I found this because I was having the same issue with Eclipse wonderful openness \u2013 the sort of reporting that raises the expectations of web applications providers a real nice Chromium dictionary Extension a graph showing the history FLOSS video editors","loc":"http://tshepang.net/links-2011-07-15"},{"title":"thanks to the Debian backports team","tags":"computing","text":"So I got this new HP laptop, Probook 4530s, and installed Debian 6 (Squeeze) on it.

I learned a lot from trying to port it away from the deprecated libglade library to a more modern gtkbuilder (part of GTK+) but the porting documentation wasn't really good, so I was left with the option doing it from scratch. Not exactly a small task. Worse still is the fact that there were more pro-looking GUI package managers out there. It didn't keep up with the pace of development wajig. It was a 2nd-class citizen. Oh, and I'm so afraid of GUI developement, or should I say GTK+. It was never an easy domain for me, and I still don't really get it. And yes, I've tried. Maybe other toolkits are easier, and I'm too lazy to check them out. I prefer backend stuff, where I don't have to deal with these GUI things. I wanted to move wajig forward into Python 3 land, and given that GTK+ support for that Python version isn't exactly mature (at time of writing), I felt that I was being held back. And don't ask me why rush for Python 3, because you are not going to get anything stronger than \"it's what the kool kids use\".","loc":"http://tshepang.net/wajig-21-released"},{"title":"from Squeeze to Unstable, and back again","tags":"computing","text":"With all the noise regarding GNOME 3, I decided to lose patience and go check it out. Thing is it's currently in Debian Experimental suite, so I installed the essential components from there, stuff like gnome-shell, mutter and gnome-panel, and things weren't so smooth. So I thought that it might be because I was still using Squeeze (Debian 6, released in February), so I upgraded my entire system to Sid (the main Debian development suite). Well, the new hotness wasn't as usable as I'd like, so I decided to go back to my rock-solid and familiar GNOME 2 environment. I was surpride that I could to downgrade the whole thing back to Squeeze, without any major hitch. Of course the downgrading process wasn't exactly smooth (lots of package removals before re-installation for one), but I'm running Squeeze as we speak. It would have been quicker for me to just re-install of course, especially because I have some installation and setup scripts to make it quick. But doing that would imply I wouln't have access to my computer for minutes on end. Not good. Also, it's nice that I continued running that fine-looking GNOME 3, while under-the-hood it was being removed. It took just a logout and back in to be back home... GNOME 2 from Squeeze.

The --no-recommends option means I want to limit the installation to packages I really need, avoiding the extra stuff deemed by the packager to be useful for me. My \"~/.jhbuilrc\" contains the following: # build directory checkoutroot = os . path . expanduser ( \"~/src/gnome\" ) # don't spew lots of distracting status messages notrayicon = True # attempt to build modules even if their dependencies weren't successfully built nopoison = True # don't build these since they have issues; this implies that I must install my distro's development versions skip = [ 'nss' , 'nspr' ] # dont fetch moduleset xml files from the web; use ones that are installed locally use_local_modulesets = True # where html-formatted logs are kept tinderbox_outputdir = os . path . expanduser ( \"~/temp/tinderbox\" ) See Configuration File Reference for a detailed explanation of these options. After this, I run jhbuild bootstrap --ignore-system . This downloads, builds, and installs the basic tools for building packages (here's the xml file it uses to determine what these tools are, and where it downloads them from). To avoid issues with some incompatibility with my OS, I use --ignore-system , which ensures that the bootstrap command will use the blessed versions of these tools. When the bootstrap process is complete, I run the not-so-descriptive command jhbuild tinderbox (See Command Reference for a detailed explanation of this and the other options). This is the same as build, except that the output is stored in html files, in a directory specified by tinderbox_outputdir in the config file. Ideally, some hours later, the process should be complete. Reaching for \"~/temp/tinderbox\" will present you with a whole bunch of html files, one for each module. The file \"index.html\" will give a decent page that acts like a summary of the entire build process, showing which modules failed, and on what build stages.

I've modified their example for the sake of simplicity: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 sub cat { foreach my $filename ( @_ ) { open FILE , $filename ; while ( my $line = <FILE> ) { print $line ; } } } cat @ARGV ; Running this script (e.g. perl cat.pl file ) will display those files as if you ran cat file . I decided to see how the Python example would look like: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 import sys def cat ( files ): for filename in files : with open ( filename ) as FILE : for line in FILE : print ( line , end = \"\" ) cat ( sys . argv [ 1 :]) Running this script (e.g. python3 cat.py file1 file2 ) will give exactly the same result as above. notes The Perl keyword, my , indicates that the variabe it refers to is local. Without that, it's taken to be global. As for Python, this is implicit, and depends on where the variable is placed (scope). Perl has special ways of identifying data types. In our example, $ is used to identify a variable that has a single value, and is known as a scalar in Perl talk. This can be tedious of course (so much typing!). In Python, the data fed into the variable is the only thing that determines what type of the variable it is. I see this as noise from Perl. It results in some badness, as in you can have two variables names be the same, but given different types (e.g. my $var; my @var; ) The upper case file handler, FILE , is a matter of convention for Perl, and can be named 'anything'. I used it in the Python sample only for the sake of clarity. The <> operator is special syntax that means a file is being manipulated. Python has no such. The @_ is an argument list ( @ARGV ) from the function call, cat . This is one other thing that is implicit about Perl, where you have to learn extra syntax (and concepts), where a simple argument list should have been provided during the function declaration, as in Python's cat(files) . Note that I didn't need to import anything to get Perl to work with command line arguments. With Python, I need to explicitly do so, and that's via the sys module , which is part of its standard library. The Python with statement is meant to make our lives easier, but also adds syntax to the language. What it does is close a file for us so we don't have to do it. The Python print() function adds a newline by default, and that would results in ugly output from our code, that's why we used the end=\"\" . The [1:] from the last statement in the Python example means that we are slicing the list, removing the first element (element 0), and keeping everything else. We do this because the current running script is considered by Python as element 0, while in Perl, the 1st element is actually the first thing that appears on the command line after the script name.

This is via the shell: import subprocess subprocess . Popen ( \"echo test\" , shell = True ) Output: test This is via the kernel: import subprocess p = subprocess . Popen ([ \"echo\" , \"test\" ], stdout = subprocess . PIPE , stderr = subprocess . PIPE ) output = p . communicate () print ( output ) Output: (b'testn', b'') Not exactly what we want. The output is actually a tuple ( stdout , stderr ). Note that by default, shell=False , and that's why it's not stated here. To get the equivalent of what we get from the first example, we have to do a bit more work: import subprocess p = subprocess . Popen ([ \"echo\" , \"test\" ], stdout = subprocess . PIPE , stderr = subprocess . PIPE ) output = p . communicate () print ( output [ 0 ] . decode (), end = \"\" ) Output: test The b thing indicates that the string is in bytes format. To get a normal string from that, just run the string's decode method . Also, that I had to use the end argument on the print function , was to avoid an empty line on the terminal output. As can be seen, this means we do much of the work ourself, but the benefit is that we now have finer-grained control (e.g. we get to control when to display the output). Another benefit is that it is more secure to do it this way (I don't know the details, so see shell injection for the argument). further reading There is a whole wealth of info on this from a gentle tutorial where I learned this stuff.

You can say the same with a stage play, except that it's never the same thing. I'm here referring to MaBrr (there is not even one credible site I found with a few minutes of search), a musical play currently seen at State Theatre, Pretoria. It's about the life and career of Brenda Fassie, a deceased South African vocalist, who was arguably the most popular of the country's artist in history. The first night was the best experience I've so far had in my stage play experience. It was electrifying and the audience agreed with me. A few goosebumps here and there. It's amazing how larger-than-life one person can be made. It brought a new appreciation of South African art (and abilities), that there's such a rich culture to export. So what are some the elements that made me so excited, the first time around: lead performance: I gained new-found respect for Lesego Motsepe, who is famous for her long career in Isidingo, a soapie generally regarded as South Africa's best; the director even mentioned that someone stated that she wasn't LIKE Brenda, but rather, she WAS Brenda; the result of the voice training she went through was amazing, because she really sounded like her character music: the compositions were remixed, and the live band bringing it alive rocked; I wish it would get recorded because some of it were improvements on the originals dancers: though the dancing merely okay, their energy was tops, especially the guys, and the quality of the choreography also helped costume design: what the dancers had to wear was mostly impressive, and often offered an accurate display of dressing styles through a bit of South Africa's past backing vocalists: wonderful, notably the fat guy, who had a tiny moment to act, which was hilarious extra emotion: well, Bongani Fassie, Brenda's son, pitched on stage unscheduled, and even joined the lead performer to sing \"Too Late for Mama\" miscellaneous: a bunch of scenes and moments are too many to mention The fact that this was opening night may have helped a lot, as well as close to sold-out venue. Now, the shitty thing about stage is that such moments can't be replicated, and even though it may have been recorderd, it's just not the same. The revisit was something else. The attendance was really bad this time around (a Thursday after Friday's opening night): lead performance: she was probably tired and/or discouraged by the small and unresponsive crowd; she mostly didn't even try to sound like Brenda music: there's wasn't a degradation, so kudos! dancing: less energy, and that there were fallen beads on stage probably didn't help costume design: same shit, so nothing to say here backing vocalists: wonderful, but the fat guy was just reciting his words this time extra emotion: well, the Bongani Fassie thing can't be replicated miscellaneous: no surprises, nothing new worth mentioning update I went to see this for the third time, this time on a Saturday, so the audience was much bigger than last time, and the show was far better, making me a little bit obsessed. lead performance: she did better than last time, but maybe not as good as the first night music: I recall enjoying the previous moments better, maybe because I got used to it dancing: the energy seemed as high as the first time around, and I enjoyed it more (I really the supercool guys at the jazz club) costume design: same shit, so nothing to say here backing vocalists: the nice fat guy was replaced by a less interesting one extra emotion: I kept getting (unbearable) attention from one dancer, since I was on the front row seats; I guess she wanted to steal the show, and I didn't allow her (she was unrelenting) so I shifted my attention away miscellaneous: the kids called up on stage were much more fun than on previous occasions","loc":"http://tshepang.net/ma-brrr"},{"title":"me loves Cherry Poptart","tags":"arts","text":"This morning I read \"Cherry Does the Time Warp\", part of the funny and politically satirical adult comic series, Cherry .

There's a useful tool in Debian named debmirror. It's function is to create and manage a partial copy of an official Debian repository, and I use it to create 2 repos: an entire i386 Debian repo for Squeeze an entire source Debian repo for Squeeze How this works is that I'd run the following command (an example for the source repo): /usr/bin/debmirror --verbose --progress --host=ftp.sun.ac.za --passive --dist=squeeze --root=ftp/debian --section=main --method=ftp --arch=none /home/wena/.repo_src (look at debmirror's manpage to see what all those options mean) The result is that I'll be having ~30GB of Debian locally (for a comparison, see total Debian archive size ). That's a lot of data, most of which I'll never use, but: I do this as a matter of convenience; I want to be able to install anything when I'm having a fresh machine, and internet access is not yet fast and cheap in South Africa. I also like to mess around with the packaging system, deleting and reinstalling packages on a whim, and I don't want to be waiting for some file to download when I do that kind of tinkering. Now, since it's ridiculous to do this every time just to have the most recent packages (a weekly update is maybe >1GB of data), I've found another wonderful tool named reprepro. It's purpose is to create a custom (unofficial) Debian repo. It's a far more advanced tool than debmirror, and I think it can do what debmirror does (but I don't yet care to learn how). Moving on, here's the relevant entries from my /etc/apt/sources.list file: # local repos (debmirror) deb file:/home/wena/.repo_bin sid main deb-src file:/home/wena/.repo_src sid main # local repo (reprepro) deb file:/home/wena/.repo_local cache main # remote repo deb ftp://ftp.sun.ac.za/ftp/debian/ sid main non-free contrib So, what I do on a semi-regular basis is run: $ wajig update && wajig upgrade The newly-updated packages are stored in a cache so that a reinstall doesn't have to fetch from network again. After this I run: $ reprepro -vv --basedir ~/.repo_local includedeb cache /var/cache/apt/archives/*deb This updates the local reprepro repo and after which I can then remove the cached packages: $ wajig clean I do that because they are now available in my reprepro-managed repo. That now means that I got a massive mirror managed by debmirror and a smaller one managed by reprepro, and I have these on an external drive for in case I want to install Debian anywhere. What else my reprepro repo has is some other packages like skype and oracle-xe , as well as an odd packages from Debian Experimental . Not so simple I guess... but works so well for my needs.","loc":"http://tshepang.net/my-debian-package-management-setup"},{"title":"apt-get vs. aptitude","tags":"computing","text":"Did I mention that I love Stack Overflow ?

How I got access to that is via a package known as anarchism , a set of documents formally known as An Anarchist FAQ . It's a very comprehensive coverage of the theory, and going through it brought both enlightenment and frustration, for it explained so many things that I took for granted, while pointing out the causes. The theory is basically presented as the best possible society humans could ever have. As for me, I'm not sure if it's actually true, although I lean more towards it than alternatives (and I haven't read anything extensive on competing theories, but intuition/experience tells me that capitalism, communism, and religion all suck tremendously). I need more study to be more sure, especially because the objections to Anarchism are heavy. To me it's a scarier concept to introduce yourself as an anarchist than as an atheist or a homosexual, because the implications are greater. In fact, they are so great, that the word anarchy itself has been associated with chaos. That's an expected knee-jerk reaction you'll get when you punt things like \"I reject all forms of official authority, including all governments!\". But it would be nice if people who shudder at the concept to spend time with that great document . My attraction to the theory perhaps is due to my radically liberal tendencies (EG, I don't see anything wrong with fucking my biological mother, provided it's consensual, and there's no pregnancy). I don't know where these tendencies originate, considering that I was a religious nut back in my early teens, scared of the concept of hell and similar forms of bullshit.","loc":"http://tshepang.net/on-anarchism"},{"title":"developer of note: Martyn Russell","tags":"computing","text":"Martyn Russell is Tracker 's release manager, and being a fan of the project since the early pre-1.0 days, I have quite familiar with his work.

So am keeping this here for its historical value... it's also not bad writing. I was having a discussion with a colleague over chat software, asking her about her major dreams. After some deliberations, and after revealing my own dream of helping a million people, I was touched when she stated she wanted to open a clinic offering free services as well as a place to help unemployed mothers. I immediately wished I was rich enough to grant her the dream. One reason I asked this question is I'm actually interested in what's in other people's minds and am often looking for inspiration. Her dream reminds of a fantasy I once had, like if I had a billion Rands (divide by ~8 to get US$), what I'd do is build a hospital and fund it for years on end. That's largely because SA public hospitals generally stink, both literally and figuratively. And while on that topic, I was recently discussing with a friend that there were other issues that escalated the problem before we even talk of insufficient funding: efficiency and corruption. While still on the dreaming side of things, someone mentioned that a dream that truly drives a person is normally ego-driven. Reminds me of a great dream of becoming a DD (Debian Developer) which kinda died . An acquaintance also has an ego-driven dream of owning a private medical lab. He did however admitted that it was a negotiable dream, and that qualifies it as a fantasy. While still on medical things, there's yet another acquaintance whose dream it is to build a clinic of some sort, but I actually forgot the details. What's interesting however is that when I asked specific questions like how big it is and some such, she couldn't answer, stating not having visualised it that far. I have learnt the importance of visualising a dream thoroughly because that solidifies it pretty well, helping it get further away from the fantasy category. Another friend also touched me when he mentioned one dream of setting up a soup kitchen for homeless people. Noble stuff that. Dreams are great because focusing on them help reduce the pain of hardship. They can be as simple as \"the salary will help me pay that debt, and maintain my lifestyle too\", and those are worthwhile dreams too, at least enough to have millions of displeased workers wake up every morning to get to work. I've also met quite a number of people whose main dream is retirement. It used to be my driving passion and motivator in building my business, but I'm now more driven by what I'll do with the ample time I'll have at my disposal after that moment, and even more than that, am driven my the million lives dream (helping a million people), most especially the ways in which I'll make that happen: starting worker co-operatives, free IT training, FLOSS (Free/Libre an Open Source Software) development funding... Actually noble dreams, the \"I want to help improve the world\" sort, are my favorites and I always get excited when someone mentions such, not those of \"I want to have this house and that car\". I probably am dishonest with myself, but as much as I drool at the sight and thought of a Bentley Continental GT, pumping the retail cost of that beauty into feeding a 100 hungry kids for a month is more my thing. I do of course have non-noble dreams: travelling Africa and the world for fun, acquiring a decent entertainment system and a serious gaming PC (am I a sucker for hardware-pushing high-end games!), visit international film festivals (am I a sucker for movies!), and even produce some short movies, preferably animated, preferably with FLOSS (I am a politically-charged wannabe!). A friend of mine, a sports sucker, wants to sponsor one kid to go professional in that field. Having loved to have had such an opportunity as a kid, he wants to ensure some deserving kid doesn't meet the same fate (and end up in career s/he dislikes). I know at least two other highly-gifted people who didn't further their sporting careers due to lack of support (likely financial). That's painful actually and shouldn't happen to anyone. Another friend of mine wants to open a dancing facility to help get kids off the streets. I'm not sure if that's a negotiable dream or not (it didn't sound like a priority item, neither did the sports sponsorship thing by the way) but we are to find out in due time...

I'll keep studying to understand more.","loc":"http://tshepang.net/anarchism-and-teen-sexuality"},{"title":"Nanotech and Open Source","tags":"misc","text":"I was fascinated to find that Christine Peterson of Nanotech fame coined the term Open Source (more or less, a business-friendly name for Free/Libre software, leading to a common compromise of calling the entire thing FLOSS for Free/Libre/Open Source Software). I remember Eric Drexler, possibly the greatest force in that most anticipated of technologies, mentioning something about FLOSS but I didn't know that he was so closely-invoved as to personally interact with Bruce Perens, one of the key FLOSS representatives.","loc":"http://tshepang.net/nanotech-and-open-source"},{"title":"Debian and Linux","tags":"computing","text":"There is a Debian history discussion among Debian old-timers where a point was raised that Ian Murdock , Debian founder, successfully transferred project leadership to someone else, a fact that Bdale Garbee stated to not yet have taken place with Linux, the poster child of FLOSS. It's also interesting to see Murdock praise successive leadership as superior to his.","loc":"http://tshepang.net/debian-and-linux"},{"title":"a visit to Eastern Cape","tags":"misc","text":"I enjoyed the beautiful countryside of Nyosini, a small (a few hundred households?) rural village nearby a buzzing Mount Frere, a town set atop a hill of the same name. This Eastern Cape village is the home of a friend of mine and the visit happened to be an excuse to see the province for the first time in my life, and the highlight was the amazing hospitality granted by the home we stayed during most of the visit, and the closeness of family I experienced here is unmatched in memory. Notable and positive mention ought be granted to 3 characters (Lwazi, Bongo, Siya) for reasons I'm too lazy to mention, much like I won't mention yet 3 more characters.

This is due to his tireless efforts as the number one GLibC co-maintainer in Debian since several months (if the package's debian changelog is to be relied upon). Also, GLibC, together with GCC and Linux, ought to be regarded as the most important packages of any GNU/Linux system.","loc":"http://tshepang.net/developer-of-note-aurelien-jarno"},{"title":"Scribes; building GNOME 2.16 with Debian","tags":"computing","text":"In order to minimize bandwidth usage, I have recently restricted myself to building a local repository consisting only of source packages as opposed to the previous times when I only did binary package downloads. This was helped by my recently-acquired skill of building Debian packages from source, most often just 3 simple commands: apt-get build-dep nautilus (retrieves nautilus' build dependencies) sudo apt-get source --build nautilus (downloads nautilus' source into current directory and builds a Debian binary package out of it) sudo dpkg --install *deb (installs the .deb files stated on the command line onto the system) I've been practicing the above procedure on several packages, including monsters like Linux, GLibC and OpenOffice.org, and it worked pretty well. I did the same for GNOME 2.16/2.18 packages (Debian GNOME maintainers haven't completed the job of migrating to 2.18 yet) available in Debian's Experimental repository . This effort was initially targetted at building 2.16 version of python-gnome and 2.10 version of python-gtk2 in order to try to build Scribes, after a previous failure. But then, since I had much GNOME infrastructure (libgtk2, libbonono, libgnomevfs2, ...) already built, I proceeded on building some of my favorites as well (nautilus, gnome-terminal, gedit, etc.), and, even though I only had ~3 hours of sleep, I woke up a happy being. I almost forgot to mention that Scribes managed to run properly, though I didn't have enough time to check it out properly. It sure looks good and am looking forward to it. [a day later] Although I managed to get Scribes to hang at least once, here's the more positive facts: I really do love the auto-save feature the interface is real clean, providing a fresh departure from the stately (and beloved) gedit it's got word-suggestion by default there's some other nifty nice features like various editing capabilities which are far more powerful than gedit provides","loc":"http://tshepang.net/scribes-building-gnome-216-with-debian"},{"title":"1st usage of RSS feeds","tags":"computing","text":"Browsing Debian Planet today led me to the usage of Google Reader. I've been ignoring this technology because I was too lazy to figure it out, but Google Reader makes it so easy it does not require me to think.

This is what I consider the first ever FLOSS contribution I ever made. I went on to make some minor code patches which also taught me a few things, like GTK+ and GLib API .","loc":"http://tshepang.net/1st-floss-patch-contribution"}]}
