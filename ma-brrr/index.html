      <p>Following are my experiences of a musical play currently seen at State
Theatre, Pretoria. It's about the life and career of Brenda Fassie, a
South African vocalist who was arguably the most popular artist in the
history of the country.</p>
<h1 id="first-viewing">First viewing</h1>
<p>The first night was the best experience I've so far had in my stage
play experience. It was electrifying and the audience agreed with me,
with a few goose-bumps here and there. It's amazing how
larger-than-life one person can be made. It brought me much appreciation
of South African art, that there's such a rich culture to export.</p>
<p>So what are some the elements that made me so excited, the first time
around:</p>
<ul>
<li>lead performance: I gained new-found respect for Lesego Motsepe, who
is famous for her long career in Isidingo, a soapie generally
regarded as South Africa's best; the director even mentioned that
someone stated that she wasn't LIKE Brenda, but rather, she WAS
Brenda; the result of the voice training she went through was
amazing, because she really sounded like her character</li>
<li>music: the compositions were remixed, and the live band bringing it
alive rocked; I wish it would get recorded because some of it were
improvements on the originals</li>
<li>dancers: though the dancing merely okay, their energy was tops,
especially the guys, and the quality of the choreography also helped</li>
<li>costume design: what the dancers had to wear was mostly impressive,
and often offered an accurate display of dressing styles through a
bit of South Africa's past</li>
<li>backing vocalists: wonderful, notably the fat guy, who had a tiny
moment to act, which was hilarious</li>
<li>extra emotion: well, Bongani Fassie, Brenda's son, pitched on stage
unscheduled, and even joined the lead performer to sing "Too Late
for Mama"</li>
<li>miscellaneous: a bunch of scenes and moments are too many to mention</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that this was opening night may have helped a lot, as well as
close to sold-out venue. Now, the shitty thing about stage is that such
moments can't be replicated, and even though it may have been recorded,
it's just not the same.</p>
<h1 id="second-viewing">Second viewing</h1>
<p>The revisit was something else. The attendance was really bad this time
around (a Thursday after Friday's opening night):</p>
<ul>
<li>lead performance: she was probably tired and/or discouraged by the
small and unresponsive crowd; she mostly didn't even try to sound
like Brenda</li>
<li>music: there's wasn't a degradation, so kudos!</li>
<li>dancing: less energy, and that there were fallen beads on stage
probably didn't help</li>
<li>costume design: same shit, so nothing to say here</li>
<li>backing vocalists: wonderful, but the fat guy was just reciting his
words this time</li>
<li>extra emotion: well, the Bongani Fassie thing can't be replicated</li>
<li>miscellaneous: no surprises, nothing new worth mentioning</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="third-viewing">Third viewing</h1>
<p>I went to see this for the third time, this time on a Saturday, so the
audience was much bigger than last time, and the show was far better,
making me a little bit obsessed.</p>
<ul>
<li>lead performance: she did better than last time, but maybe not as
good as the first night</li>
<li>music: I recall enjoying the previous moments better, maybe because
I got used to it</li>
<li>dancing: the energy seemed as high as the first time around, and I
enjoyed it more (I really the super-cool guys at the jazz club)</li>
<li>costume design: same shit, so nothing to say here</li>
<li>backing vocalists: the nice fat guy was replaced by a less
interesting one</li>
<li>extra emotion: I kept getting (unbearable) attention from one
dancer, since I was on the front row seats; I guess she wanted to
steal the show, and I didn't allow her (she was unrelenting) so I
shifted my attention away</li>
<li>miscellaneous: the kids called up on stage were much more fun than
on previous occasions</li>
</ul>
