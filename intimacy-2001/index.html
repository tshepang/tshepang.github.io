      <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_Fox">Kerry Fox</a> is amazing as a character cheating on husband, while the guy
he is cheating with is an extremely annoying ass who nearly tells on
her, not because he is moral, but because he is jealous. The character
is unbearable, and so is the performance. Another annoying character is
the delinquent friend, whose sole purpose must have been just that...
to annoy me. Another unpleasant character, though the only one that
seems sensible, is the strange bar man, perhaps because I could not
figure him out. He just feels so arbitrary, as does that delinquent
friend. One performance I enjoyed most was that of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Spall">Timothy Spall</a>. It
was likely the first time I ever saw him (I saw this movie first time
several years ago), which is something that instantly earned him my
respect.</p>
<p>The writers did quite well in terms of character development here, but
not so well on the entertainment side, which is an even more important
attribute. Movies are, after all, primarily meant to entertain. In too
many places, the movie is hard to bear, and it would be quite strange if
anyone involved actually enjoyed the experience of making it. It is all
humorless and dull, and full of pain, and disturbed characters.</p>
