      <p>I haven't ran Ubuntu since 7.04 and gave 8.10 a try recently, primarily
for doing wireless web connection at new job, and also that our sysadmin
showed it to me in action with its NetworkManager 0.7 glory in action
and had the installer handy. As I've come to expect from Ubuntu, the
defaults artwork just looks gorgeous and with an especially stunning
desktop background. It was also the first time I actually got to
experience the 3D desktop effects that people have been making noise
about these past several months (I did try this before, on Debian, but
it was a mess with me having to go see README.Debian thing and still not
managing, while in Ubuntu's case, it was mere clicks away which I found
through the handy Ubuntu user manual, which is easily accessible on the
GNOME panel, and that's what Debian desktop needs).</p>
<p>Me became happy with Firefox which remembered the previously-visited
paths (via the back-button) on session-restore, a feature I often miss
when working with Epiphany.</p>
<p>Some warts I've seen so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>The installer's insistence on running the whole desktop before
installation sucks because it really prolongs installation, and made
worse by a lack of a visible alternative option.</li>
<li>The feature I once praised in debian-installer, which informs one of
the limits whithin which one may resize existing hard drive
partitions, is absent in Ubuntu's installer. The graphical
partitioner does however looks real slick.</li>
<li>Does not remember running apps when session is restarted.</li>
<li>And I've already experienced 2 system freezes after running some
updates, and the sort where I have to force machine reset.</li>
</ul>
