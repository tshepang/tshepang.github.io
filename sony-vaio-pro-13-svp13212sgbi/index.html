    <div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>On <strong>2014-02-13</strong> I went to collect <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xq-ZBke68tA">the laptop</a> from <a href="http://www.comx.co.za">these guys</a>,
which I paid around R12500 (~$1200) for. It's a 4GB RAM, 128GB SSD,
FHD model. I would have happily paid for more RAM and storage, but this
seems the only model available in my home country. I am glad that it's
also not a touch screen... I don't need the reflection.</p>
<p>Anyways, there was much pain involved trying to get it to work. I
struggled to get Debian booting, and I don't know what I did wrong
because after a few attempts of trying this and that, things worked. And
man, that SSD is fast: it takes 6-7 seconds to GUI login screen. Package
installation is also insane fast.</p>
<p>There was much pain trying to get audio to work. Luckily <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Sony_Vaio_Pro_SVP-1x21#Sound">I got some
help</a>, where I needed to change two lines in
<code>/usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf</code>:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>defaults.ctl.card 1
</span><span>defaults.pcm.card 1
</span></code></pre>
<p>VLC video didn't work well either, but I needed only change Video
Output to <strong>OpenGL GLX video output (XCB)</strong>, and all was well.</p>
<h1 id="performance">Performance</h1>
<p>I am now going to check how this machine compares to <a href="http://tshepang.github.io/a-bit-of-benchmarking/">these others</a>.</p>
<p>Specs:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>$ uname --all

<p>So the machine still doesn't compare with my work machine, a ~2
year-old desktop. It is faster than my old laptop as expected, and
comparable to the DigitalOcean VPS, no surprises there. The storage is a
lot faster though... I've seen sustained read speeds of ~500MB/s.</p>
<h1 id="issues">Issues</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The corners of the laptop are rather sharp, making it a little
uncomfortable to handle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The power button is not so easy to press, and offers very little
'feedback'... it has very shallow movement. Luckily there should
not be a frequent need to use it, but there are times when something
is buggy enough to cause OS hangs and other misbehaviour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fan is too quick to kick in, and easily gets noisy. Running the
following commands does not help, at least not in a way I could
notice:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>echo silent | sudo tee  /sys/devices/platform/sony-laptop/thermal_control
</span></code></pre>
<p>I don't know why this happens, given that I have never seen the
temperature rise above 60 Â°C:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>$ sensors
</span><span>acpitz-virtual-0
</span><span>Adapter: Virtual device
</span><span>temp1:        +48.0Â°C  (crit = +97.0Â°C)
</span><span>
</span><span>coretemp-isa-0000
</span><span>Adapter: ISA adapter
</span><span>Physical id 0:  +48.0Â°C  (high = +100.0Â°C, crit = +100.0Â°C)
</span><span>Core 0:         +46.0Â°C  (high = +100.0Â°C, crit = +100.0Â°C)
</span><span>Core 1:         +45.0Â°C  (high = +100.0Â°C, crit = +100.0Â°C)
</span></code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>The screen brightness control is painful. It requires one to press
the combination of the <strong>Fn</strong> key and <strong>F5</strong> (dim) and <strong>F6</strong>
(brighten), which is fine. But one cannot just hold the two latter
keys, but has to repeatedly press them to reach the desired result.
That would not be such a big problem, except that it takes such a
long time to get there... more than 50 presses from the two
extremes!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I still haven't got used to <strong>Pg Up/Dn</strong> and <strong>Home/End</strong> being
accessible only via the <strong>Fn</strong> key. It's so awkward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The touchpad is a great pleasure to use, except when pressing and
dragging. It's a hit-and-miss affair... you have to press quite
hard, and that makes precise control challenging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The flexibility of the body results in keyboard marks on the screen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The worst problem, however, is the flexibility of at the bottom of
the touchpad. Too often the touchpad fails to respond because I've
put the thing at the wrong angle... I mostly use my laptop in bed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
