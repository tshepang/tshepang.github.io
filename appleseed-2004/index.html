      <p>In animation, I don't remember seeing a face of a female character as
beautifully shot as the lead character here. We also get to have
multiple such moments (she really is gorgeous!), which makes me suspect
the director must have oogled over her. The one problem though is that
she doesn't exactly look the part of a supremely skilled warrior. Her
great strength is also left unexplained.</p>
<p>There are 2 more characters that could have been better:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hitomi, the leader of the rescue mission that helped the lead; she
sucks because she was chosen merely for some Japanese idea of sex
appeal, the sort so common in erotic Japanese soft porn stuff;
that's no problem, except her character doesn't fit the role, and
in a more severe manner than the lead herself.</li>
<li>Dr. Gilliam Knute, the genius creator of a species similar to
humans, is also designed purely for sex appeal (she is pretty too).
She really isn't my idea of the character she's forced into. Also,
the moments involving her aren't done very well, a lame attempt to
give the movie emotional punch.</li>
</ul>
<p>Much of the visual design is quite nice, but is inconsistently so. The
fusion of 2D and 3D is a bit poor, but some of the movements of the
characters (e.g. some movements like walking, or fighting) are quite
impressive. As for the designs of the exo-skeleton, did they have to
look so bulky? Anyways, the catwoman-like robots are wonderful to look
at, complete with their metal-cutting whips. This is one case where sex
appeal worked well.</p>
