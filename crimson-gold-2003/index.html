      <p>This is a one-of-a-kind movie (almost) following a small-time
crook/pizza delivery guy (Hussein) on his devoid-of-excitement journey
around some densely-populated city. The guy playing him has a lot of
presence (and he's really fun to watch), even though in a typical
Hollywood, he would be reduced to merely a secondary character. The
direction is such that you feel affinity with the main characters, and
they feel as real as any movie can make them.</p>
<p>There's a few wonderful moments in the movie:</p>
<ul>
<li>The scene where our normally-sad protagonist passes time by giving
pizza away, and he does this to some of his captives. That act
kindness gave me warm and fuzzy feelings.</li>
<li>The scene where our protagonist delivers pizza to a rich guy, who
invites him to stay and enjoy the pizza with him. The motivation is
that he needed to vent a bit and needed some ears for that.
Hussein's unwillingness reminded me of the Travis Bickle (Robert De
Niro) in the classic scene of <em>Taxi Driver</em>, where one passenger
talks about the pain of a cheating wife... well except that rich
man's pain isn't quite as intense. The scene also serves to show
the heavy contrast between the worlds of the rich and the poor (and
you should compare rich man's place with Hussein's; it's
ridiculous how the world came to be like this).</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though almost nothing happens (at least as compared to normal
Hollywood fare), the movie also covers the issue of sexual oppression,
but very skillfully and subtly, and in more than one occasion. It made
me appreciate some of the pleasures we have here in South Africa.</p>
<p>The style of this movie is very similar to that of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbas_Kiarostami">Abbas Kiarostami</a>
(<em>A Taste of Cherry</em> and <em>The Wind Will Carry Us</em>), and that's not
strange since he wrote the screenplay, and is considered by the director
as his mentor. Most notable, it's far better than those two boring
pieces.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>sidenote</strong>: Jonathan Rosenbaum, the best movie critic I've read, has a <a href="http://www.jonathanrosenbaum.com/?p=6061">superb
and highly-detailed review</a>. He's also the one that inspired me to
watch the movie for he is a huge fan of it, to the point of labeling
it a masterpiece.</p>
