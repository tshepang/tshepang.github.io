      <p>A reasonably enjoyable movie that is sadly showing its age. Luckily
there's many nice performances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Holly Hunter: I didn't even notice it was her, until I saw the
credits; it's been a while I guess; she plays the lover of the
private investigator.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Busey">Gary Busey</a>: He's fun to watch as private investigator. He gets
some of the movie's best dialogue. Also, I don't remember enjoying
any of his performances, until now.</li>
<li>Ed Harris: This is one good actor, and I only wish he was given
enough great roles, instead of playing second fiddle to lesser
actors like Tom Cruise. The scene where he breaks in anger, where he
reveals the size of his balls to the Tom Cruise character, is solid.</li>
<li>David Strathairn: The character of the hero's brother was rather
misplaced and was given too much importance. It was just not
needed for the story. That however shouldn't make us ignore the
fact that it was performed well.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a bunch of desirable women too, not least of which was the great
Holly Hunter herself. Another is the wife, and another (the most
desirable) is the lady who seduced our hero on the beach in what is
easily the silliest moment in the movie.</p>
<p>[<strong>sidenote</strong>]
Now, this Gary Busy guy is one prolific guy,
with over 120 movie appearances! I think most are shit though, as is
often the case with actors this active. Remember <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Hopper_filmography">Dennis Hopper</a>?</p>
