      <p>The new suit is a lot more interesting (think the 2008 <em>Iron Man</em>), and
greater detail given to the workings of the man-machine combo. There is
good quality visual affects, and the movie was fun enough to have me
wish for a longer running length. I wish better actors were chosen for
the roles of wife and partner, and it would have been nice had this
partner been given a meatier role. Better still, it should have been a
woman, in honor of the 1987 movie. Or better still, get rid of the
partner. There's enough other things to keeping things interesting. I
also wish someone else was chosen in place of the uninteresting Gary
Oldman, the same person who made the Nolan Batman trilogy less bearable
than it needed to be.</p>
<p>The crime-fighting part was rather rushed, and the story not very solid.
I enjoyed watching Samuel L. Jackson play a commentator, and the first
scene was really good, though it felt like more was left to be said.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a great reboot. I can't tell if it's better than the
original for it's been too long, but I think it's less scary, but also
less cartoonish. The lead actor is also not as interesting. Younger yes,
but a lesser actor, and a boring face actually.</p>
