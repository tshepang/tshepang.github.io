      <p>It's strange that Spike Lee covered 2 issues, cheating and racism, in a
single movie, and none reduced to a subplot. What's also strange is
that there's little to celebrate in this tired and ageing <em>Jungle
Fever</em> (given Lee's amazing credentials), although the scene where the
protagonist resigns is commendable. Another strange thing is it was the
first time I saw this piece of shit, old and popular as it is.</p>
<p>I also don't like the fact that someone(s) claimed that <em>TransAmerica</em>
is excellent. Sure we don't get much movie coverage of transgender
issues, but I hate it when artistic prowess is ignored in favour of
politics when judging excellence. By the way I became surprised that the
protagonist was played by a woman.</p>
<p>It always is a pleasure watching the lead villain of the <em>Saw</em> movie
series, which really pushes the boundaries as regards
unbearably-explicit gore, but most importantly, a rather fresh and
powerful premise (having individuals choose between separate ghastly
ends, one of which leads to survival). I even feel that he outdoes
himself here in the fourth installment, which unfortunately feels
hurried while also employing excessive use of editing to enhance certain
scenes.</p>
<p>The supporting cast of <em>Room 1408</em> did quite a commendable job, most
notably Alexandra Silber's turn as a fan of one of the author's work.
Even Samuel L. Jackson isn't annoying as usual, but I wish the movie's
premise could have been explained better.</p>
<p><em>Hellboy 2</em> is far better than its predecessor and offers the sort of
creature extravaganza only last seen in the <em>Star Wars</em> series. Its
central concept is similar to that of <em>The Mummy 3</em> (awakening an
ancient and near-indestructible army) and I wonder if the writers were
aware. Luckily the material received better treatment in this <em>Hellboy
2</em>. And it's also amazing that you can get such amazing martial arts
choreography in Yuen Woo Ping's absence. Oh, and I couldn't help but
notice that the walking fish is modeled after that talkative robot in
<em>Star Wars</em>. It's also obvious that some (at least one) of the creature
designs were inspired by childkiller from <a href="https://tshepang.github.io/pan-s-labyrinth-2006/">Pan's Labyrinth</a>, and much
of the designs look childish and unconvincing.</p>
<p>R. Lee Ermey doesn't miss a step in the bad and unnecessary horror
flick, <em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning</em>.</p>
<p>One movie that should be forbidden from the eyes of all is <em>The
Forbidden Kingdom</em>, even though I <a href="https://tshepang.github.io/recent-movies-2008-05-28/">enjoyed it more previously</a>.</p>
