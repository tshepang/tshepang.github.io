      <p>This is easily among the most active of all core CPython developers. His
productivity is ridiculous, and I seriously wonder how he manages to do
all he does, especially since <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2012-February/014139.html">he does it in his free time</a>. He also
tends to be quite stern, which is extra kool since he does it while
displaying <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2012-February/013835.html">great depth of knowledge</a> and <a href="http://hg.python.org/peps/rev/8a6e3b28dbef">maturity</a>. Also, his great
work has been <a href="http://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-awards/#september-2011">officially recognized by the Python Software Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>The first work that prompted this recognition as <a href="http://tshepang.github.io/tags/developer-of-note">developer of note</a> is
the proposal, <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0413/">PEP 413</a>. The idea is that the Python standard library
(stdlib) should release at a quicker rate than the Python language
itself. This is a nice balance between two camps: those favoring
<em>stability</em> over quicker availability of features, and those favoring
the opposite. The PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal) is quite thorough,
and is partly in opposition to the earlier <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0407">PEP 407</a>, which proposes
that all of CPython (the language and its stdlib) should release faster.
Nick Coghlan outlines the disadvantages with that approach in PEP 413 as
well.</p>
<p>Another PEP he is working on is <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0432">PEP 432</a>. Titled <em>Simplifying the
CPython startup sequence</em>, it's a highly detailed proposal to
re-organise some of CPython code to ease maintenance. His deep knowledge
on the project's internals is also on display.</p>
<p>Nick also builds and maintains a collection of notes known simply as
<a href="http://python-notes.boredomandlaziness.org/en/latest/index.html">Nick Coghlan's Python Notes</a>. There is much wisdom there (complete
with high quality clear writing), favorite of which is the just-updated
<a href="http://python-notes.boredomandlaziness.org/en/latest/pep_ideas/core_packaging_api.html#incremental-plans-to-improve-python-packaging">Incremental Plans to Improve Python Packaging</a>, a thorough write-up on
the history, current state, and future plans regarding the story of
packaging (and installation) in the Python ecosystem. He also happens to
be a great champion in pushing for progress on that front.</p>
