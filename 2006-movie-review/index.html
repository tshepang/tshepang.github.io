      <h2 id="movie-of-the-year">movie of the year</h2>
<p><em>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest</em> for its visual splendour
and excitement. The runner-up in this category is <a href="http://tshepang.github.io/shaolin-soccer-2001/">Shaolin Soccer</a>,
which is made by the same guy who made 2005's movie of the year, <a href="http://tshepang.github.io/kung-fu-hustle-2004/">Kung
Fu Hustle</a>.</p>
<h2 id="best-movie">best movie</h2>
<p><a href="http://tshepang.github.io/the-butterfly-effect-2004/">The Butterfly Effect</a> is the year's best movie, followed by <a href="http://tshepang.github.io/birth/">Birth</a>.
There is stiff competition coming from the exciting and superb
<em>Confessions of A Dangerous Mind</em> as well as <a href="http://tshepang.github.io/lord-of-war-2005/">Lord of War</a>. Such a
listing convinces me that, although the year wasn't as exciting, it
probably had more supreme movies compared to <a href="http://tshepang.github.io/2005-movie-review/">2005</a>.</p>
<h2 id="spectacle-of-the-year">spectacle of the year</h2>
<p>Nothing beats <em>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest</em> in terms of
size, not to mention breath-taking effects.</p>
<h2 id="performance-of-the-year">performance of the year</h2>
<p>Crispin Glover shines in a bizarre performance in the surreal <a href="http://tshepang.github.io/dead-man-1995/">Dead
Man</a>. Another favorite of mine is the almost comic one of James Caan in
<a href="http://tshepang.github.io/dogville-2003/">Dogville</a>, however the year's favorite is easily Eamonn Walker's
dictator in <a href="http://tshepang.github.io/lord-of-war-2005/">Lord of War</a>, a great highlight of an already brilliant
movie. I found the character portrayal of Tia Dalma, the witch in <em>Dead
Man's Chest</em>, the closest competitor to Eamonn Walker's character.</p>
<h2 id="best-female-performance">best female performance</h2>
<p>Nicole Kidman's perplexed widow in <a href="http://tshepang.github.io/birth/">Birth</a> is her most intense and best
ever. The most touching of female performances however goes to Amy
Smart's in <a href="http://tshepang.github.io/the-butterfly-effect-2004/">The Butterfly Effect</a> for the part in which she's a wasted
waiter.</p>
<h2 id="best-male-performance">best male performance</h2>
<p>Jack Nicholson steals the screen away from the two leads of <em>Easy
Rider</em>, while John Malkovich is notable for <em>Ripley's Game</em>. Another
impressive, but overly self-conscious performance, is that for the
daring show host found in <em>V for Vendetta</em>.</p>
<h2 id="best-cast">best cast</h2>
<p><em>Red Dragon</em> wins in this category due to luminous appearances from the
likes of Anthony Hopkins, Edward Norton, Emily Watson, etc.</p>
<h2 id="direction">direction</h2>
<p>George Clooney really outdoes himself (even considering this is a debut)
in the beautifully-crafted <em>Confessions of A Dangerous Mind</em>. This is
not nearly the genius that is shown in Darren Aronofsky's <a href="http://tshepang.github.io/pi-1997/">Pi</a>, and
only masters wind up making electrifying fables like <em>A History of
Violence</em>.</p>
<h2 id="beautiful-imagery">beautiful imagery</h2>
<p>The festival depicted in <em>Ghost in the Shell 2</em> is breathtaking.
Runner-up is <em>Rize</em>'s well-sculpted climactic scene, the one in which
the performers dance to the sun with oil-covered skin, is so illustrious
the characters seem god-like.</p>
<h2 id="irritating-disturbing">irritating, disturbing</h2>
<p><em>Life Aquatic</em> takes the lead here.</p>
<h2 id="action-movie">action movie</h2>
<p>Me not being comfortable about the fact that there weren't too many
competitors, <em>Assault on Precinct 13</em> still deserves attention for its
action (though it's no <em>Die Hard</em>) and good direction, even though
it's got nothing fresh.</p>
<h2 id="scariest">scariest</h2>
<p><a href="http://tshepang.github.io/birth/">Birth</a> wins for its edge-of-the-seat, slow thrills, well-enhanced by
its performances, owed to Nicole and the boy.</p>
<h2 id="script">script</h2>
<p>Only a genius could be held responsible for <a href="http://tshepang.github.io/the-butterfly-effect-2004/">The Butterfly Effect</a>'s
superb, complex, and rich storyline. <a href="http://tshepang.github.io/lord-of-war-2005/">Lord of War</a> deserves honorable
mention for its very fresh take on gun-running, which happened to be a
foreign idea to me.</p>
<h2 id="prison-depiction">prison depiction</h2>
<p>This ain't no standard category, but nothing in my history of film
viewing beats what's shown in <a href="http://tshepang.github.io/the-butterfly-effect-2004/">The Butterfly Effect</a>.</p>
<h2 id="character-design">character design</h2>
<p>The gorgeous designs in <em>A Corpse Bride</em> are breathtaking, but this only
applies to living humans and not the ghosts, which are too gimmicky for
my liking.</p>
<h2 id="strangest-movie">strangest movie</h2>
<p>This honor goes to the weird <a href="http://tshepang.github.io/dead-man-1995/">Dead Man</a> which has some very memorable
scenes; It also has the honor of being totally respected by
master-critic, Jonathan Rosenbaum.</p>
<h2 id="cinematography">cinematography</h2>
<p><em>Man on Fire</em>, with excellent, grainy touches and handheld camerawork,
is followed by <em>Constantine</em>'s gorgeous shots, <em>Delicatessen</em>'s
ultra-polished images and, to a lesser extent, <em>Tsotsi</em>'s shots of
SA's less pleasant living conditions.</p>
<h2 id="music">music</h2>
<p><em>Tsotsi</em>'s energetic Kwaito beats are well-executed, enhancing the
movie.</p>
<h2 id="war-movie">war movie</h2>
<p><em>Tears of the Sun</em> shows the tough realities of African guerilla
warfare, distorted as it may be.</p>
<h2 id="production-design">production design</h2>
<p>Tough competition sees <em>Constantine</em>, <em>Man on Fire</em>, <em>Spiderman 2</em>, and
<em>Tsotsi</em> battling without a clear winner.</p>
<h2 id="visual-effects">visual effects</h2>
<p><em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> is up there with <em>King Kong</em> among the
greatest ever visual spectacles. An honorable mention goes to <em>SpiderMan
2</em> and another to the lower-budget entrant, <em>Constantine</em>.</p>
<h2 id="sound">sound</h2>
<p><em>The Ring</em> uses wonderful sound to achieve its scare effort and is
followed closely by <em>Man on Fire</em>.</p>
<h2 id="editing">editing</h2>
<p>Nothing beats <em>The Ring</em> here especially with the well-done flashbacks.
Runner-up is <em>Man on Fire</em>.</p>
<h2 id="voice-talent-and-voice-overs">voice talent and voice-overs</h2>
<p>One could watch <em>Sin City</em> just for the tough guy, deep male voices
heard throughout.</p>
<h2 id="shit">shit</h2>
<p><em>Star Wars III</em> has the worst editing, worst acting, worst sound, worst
direction, but got beaten by <em>Eurotrip</em> as worst movie.</p>
