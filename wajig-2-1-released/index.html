      <p>Today I released <a href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/w/wajig/news/20110427T131707Z.html">a new version of wajig</a>, first time in about half a
year. It's not even like there's some major stuff or anything; I just
haven't put as much time. Regardless, it's quite a good release.</p>
<p>One of the changes is getting rid of gjig, the GUI interface.</p>
<ul>
<li>I actually did like it, but it was never a production standard piece
of code. It was actually quite nifty and useful, but the interface
was not at all modern or usual. It also needed a lot of polish.</li>
<li>I learned a lot from trying to port it away from the deprecated
libglade library to a more modern gtkbuilder (part of GTK+). But the
porting documentation wasn't really good, so I was left with the
option of doing it from scratch... not exactly a small task.</li>
<li>Worse still is the fact that there were more pro-looking GUI package
managers out there.</li>
<li>It didn't keep up with the pace of development wajig. It was a
2nd-class citizen.</li>
<li>Oh, and I'm so afraid of GUI development, or should I say GTK+. It
was never an easy domain for me, and I still don't really get it.
And yes, I've tried. Maybe other toolkits are easier, and I'm too
lazy to check them out.</li>
<li>I wanted to move wajig forward into Python 3 land, and given that
GTK+ support for that Python version isn't exactly mature (at time
of writing), I felt that I was being held back.</li>
</ul>
