      <p>I was invited to a show named <em>Best Friends, Worst Enemies</em> which I
described as "so bad it's offensive". And I actually was offended,
which was made worse by an appreciative audience, and they even stood up
at the end of it, offering an ovation. I did not like it because I found
neither the story nor the characters interesting enough to deserve the
stage. I just don't see how people would find any of what was shown
profound or special or new. I complained to 3 people who also watched
the show, and they could not understand what my issues were (how does
one explain to another that a piece of art is not interesting). I also
felt like walking out, and could not wait for the end.</p>
<p>Basic story: 4 wayward friends (sex and drugs) find baby at door step,
and a letter they find proclaims one of them a father, leading them to
do paternity tests, and ending with a dumb twist. There is humor all
over the place, none of which is particularly good. There are also
contrived circumstances and... fuck, there is nothing there!</p>
<p>Anyways, as I complained about the show, someone passively invited me to
another show named <em>Day of Absence</em>, which was such a pleasure. Concept
is great (and fresh)... "white face" black performers play roles of
white people in shitty-ass USA where blacks are treated like sub-humans,
in a society so dependent on them that chaos ensues when they
mysteriously disappear. There's lots of good humor, there's decent
dialog, a wonderful performance by the guy playing mayor, and superb use
of breaking the 4th wall, where the director would complain about
mistakes the cast made, asking for re-takes. Another involved lighting
problems, which, I later found out weren't actually part of the show,
yet served it so well.</p>
<p>Show wasn't perfect, and there was even a moment were I felt sleepy. I
also felt the accents could do with a bit of work where, for example, I
could not tell at times if they were mimicking black or white Americans. I
sometimes also struggled with hearing what the fuck they were saying,
though that could also be a property of those accents. I felt
inconsistencies in those accents as well.</p>
<p>Despite those (rather minor) complaints, the director deserves much
respect for what she created (what's her name?).</p>
