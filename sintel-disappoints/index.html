      <p><a href="http://www.sintel.org/">Sintel</a> is the latest movie project by the Blender Foundation, and
they've been cooking it for over a year now, and the result is really
disappointing, and as with their <a href="https://tshepang.github.io/project-peach-disappoints/">previous movie</a>, I still feel that
their first movie, <em>Elephants Dream</em>, is superior both technically and
artistically.</p>
<ul>
<li>human character animation is really bad, maybe worse than the first
<em>Toy Story</em>; okay they could not afford motion-capture suits, so I
guess they can be forgiven?</li>
<li>the whole thing looks unfinished (EG, much of the environment looks
too clean, too smooth)</li>
<li>character design sux; just look at the old man, and the dragons</li>
<li>the lead character is not interesting, nor is she a convincing
warrior; maybe a juicier ass would have helped, since I suspect the
movie-makers chose a female character for sex appeal; how else am I
supposed to swallow a story where a 16-year old woman holds her own
while battling a few unfriendly characters (including a fully-grown
dragon!)</li>
<li>the whole thing feels empty; when the credits roll you murmur
something along the lines of "is that it!"</li>
</ul>
<p>On a more positive note, the final battle is rather intense, and I wish
it should have lasted longer. Otherwise there isn't much in this that
motivates me to go watch this 15-minute piece again. That this was done
with FLOSS is not grounds for a dishonest review.</p>
