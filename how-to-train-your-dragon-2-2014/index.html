      <p>I loved the character design of the mother, and that includes both the
look and movements. She was even better when masked, possessing
awe-inspiring presence, a feeling enhanced by her great skill with the
dragons. 'Her' dragons, which are newer designs from those from <a href="https://tshepang.github.io/how-to-train-your-dragon-2010/">the
earlier movie</a>, also received great design, most impressive of which is
the Alpha. Exploring the home of these dragons was quite an experience,
which is weird, given the careless character design elsewhere (e.g. most
of the human characters). The epic feel is among the greatest I've
experienced of any movie.</p>
<p>The movie is full of quality humor. Among my favorites is the romantic
attraction expressed by the girl for the new guy. It's recycled stuff,
but well executed. There was also good humor (and charms) from the
dragons; check how playful they are with each other.</p>
<p>I wish more time was spent with the mother, since she is easily the most
interesting character in the movie. Instead, she's later reduced to a
secondary character, and not even instrumental in the victory her son
emerges from. Also, the writers mostly neglected the promise she made to
teach this son about the dragons. Instead the movie rushes too quickly
to the son (and his dragon) being pretty much the sole hero of the
movie. So shallow, so sad. Wasted opportunity.</p>
