      <p>Why did I watch Why Did I Get Married? To answer the question, it was
mostly out of curiosity really, and that's because it proved a hit
among female Black folk.</p>
<p>Why I wasn't interested in from the onset is because I expected sobby
and formulaic non-sense and that wasn't helped much by a history of
shitty Black American romance (which normally went straight to video).
Well it turned much worse that i expected actually with a dumb and
amateurish script and disgustingly-bad performances, especially from
Jill Scott, that very same individual who took part in what I'm tempted
to call the best modern RnB album ever, Who's Jill Scott. What of Janet
Jackson in a performance much lesser than that she gave in Poetic
Justice? And I kept wondering what's up with the constant preaching
about God's love and shit like that. Why shitty ass dialogue like this
ever sees the big screen truly is mysterious!</p>
<p>More Black American shit can be found in the other popular romance, Love
&amp; Basketball, which feels like a bad sitcom, but with worse lighting and
script; it was a bit shocking to find that Spike Lee was involved, as
co-producer.</p>
