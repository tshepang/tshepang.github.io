      <p>The most shocking thing about this overrated bore is that it was made by
Lee Daniels, the same guy who made the most impressive movie made in
the last few years, <em>Precious</em> (2009). It's fucking weird! It's among the most
surprising things in all of my experiences watching movies. Not even a
wonderful actor like Forest Whitaker pulled off a decent performance.
He's embarrassing even, though not as much as Oprah Winfrey, who was
supposed to be a quality actor, given her <em>Color Purple</em> performance
(though I haven't seen that in over 10 years). Something must have gone
seriously wrong. Maybe it was a troubled production?</p>
<p>Anyways, it's not utter trash. I liked the concept of the heroic
activists being prepared for racist taunts, which was quite fresh. Not
that it was particularly well-made, but that it's just something I
haven't seen before in a movie. Another highlight is the character of
the younger brother of the activist at the dinner table, specifically
the <em>party</em> moment. It was beautiful. Sadly, not much else was. None of
the other performances were good (and I'm not exaggerating), and the
old-age make-up was even worse. Ridiculous!</p>
