      <p>This is the most extensive Director's Cut I've seen yet. There is so
much that is different:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most regretful is the absence of the Kris Kristofferson character,
whose role of head of The Outfit is replaced by a female voice. This
itself isn't so bad, if we ignore that Kris was amazing to watch,
most especially the moment he first appeared on screen (amazing
direction).</li>
<li>There is one moment of domestic abuse that is rather hard to
swallow. I thought it was quite daring (and surprising), especially
because a character we are supposed to like is the perpetrator. This
moment alone makes it understandable why it was edited out.</li>
<li>The ending is a lot different and more involved (and perhaps a bit
over-the-top), but superior overall.</li>
<li>Two of the bodyguards were totally removed from the original cut,
which is rather sad for they given wonderful performances (they look
mean as fuck). I am referring to the two who drive the Val Resnick
character about.</li>
<li>I could be wrong, but I felt like there were more shots of the
city's environment, which makes me appreciate the great production
design both movies display. Wonderful.</li>
<li>The first scene from the earlier movie, the one in which Potter is
getting bullets removed from his body, is missing. It's among my
favorite scenes, and displays very well the darkness the movie
explores, complete with a curious medical practitioner.</li>
<li>The lead character's voice-over is missing, and was actually quite
good. This version proves it wasn't essential though.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I find <a href="http://tshepang.github.io/payback-1999/">the earlier release</a> superior, but not by a big margin.</p>
